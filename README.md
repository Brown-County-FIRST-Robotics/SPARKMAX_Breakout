# Encoder_Breakout
A breakout for the SPARKMAX data port to connect to a ThriftyBot Absolute Encoder using latching MTE connectors. 
# Usage
Before connecting the encoder to the SPARKMAX, make sure to change it to 3.3v logic level. Intstructions to do so can be found [here on page 9](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13NQDb2Zo_SesC1MDLzDeBgxTNhccqtUq/view).
